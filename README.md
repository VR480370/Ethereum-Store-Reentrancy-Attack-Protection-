# Ethereum-Store-Reentrancy-Attack-Protection-
Made an Ethereum Store contract and an attacker contract using solidity  programing language on an open-source Ethereum IDE use to write, compile and  debug Solidity code and perform the reentrancy. We prevent reentrancy attack by updating the code before we make any eternal calls and  secondly using the no reentrant function modifier.
