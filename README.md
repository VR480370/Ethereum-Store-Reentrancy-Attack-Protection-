# Ethereum-Store-Reentrancy-Attack-Protection-
Made an Ethereum Store contract and an attacker contract using solidity  programing language on an open-source Ethereum IDE use to write, compile and  debug Solidity code and perform the reentrancy. We prevent reentrancy attack by updating the code before we make any eternal calls and  secondly using the no reentrant function modifier.

OBJECTIVES 
The main objectives of our project are following: 
• Creating an Ethereum Smart Contract using the platform of 
remix.ethereum.org 
• Creating an Attacker Contract for Reentrancy Attack.  
• Looting the Ethereum wallet using Reentrancy Attack. 
• Implementing the two security solutions to avoid the digital assets being stolen. 
• Again, Attacking the system to test our security solutions.
